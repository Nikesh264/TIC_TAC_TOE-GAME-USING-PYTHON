The code you provided is a Python program for a simple command-line tic-tac-toe (or noughts and crosses) game that allows two players to play against each other. Here's an overview of how the code works:

1. `create_board(box)`: This function initializes an empty 3x3 tic-tac-toe board represented as a list of lists (`box`). It populates the board with empty spaces.

2. `get_board(box)`: This function prints the current state of the tic-tac-toe board on the console. It uses loops to iterate through the rows and columns of the board and prints the 'X' or 'O' in each cell.

3. `toss()`: This function simulates a coin toss to decide which player goes first. The player who wins the toss gets to choose between 'X' and 'O'.

4. `selection(toss_choice)`: This function allows the player who won the toss to select their symbol ('X' or 'O'). If the input is not valid, it prompts the player to enter a valid choice.

5. `is_winner(board, player)`: This function checks if the given player has won the game by examining rows, columns, and diagonals of the board.

6. `is_board_full(board)`: This function checks if the board is full, indicating a tie game.

7. `make_move(board, player)`: This function allows the current player to make a move by entering their desired row and column coordinates.

8. `play_game()`: This is the main function that orchestrates the entire game. It initializes the board, calls `toss()` to decide the starting player, and enters a loop where players take turns making moves until there is a winner or a tie.

9. The game continues until one player wins or the board is full (tie), at which point it prints the result.

To play the game, you would run the script, and two players would take turns entering their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. The game will continue until there's a winner or a tie.

Please note that the code as provided should work correctly, assuming Python 3.x is used. If you have any specific questions or issues with the code, feel free to ask.
